                        Welcome to the America’s Essential Hospitals online support guide. This interactive guide will give you an overall understanding of how to use various features within the content management system (CMS) for America’s Essential Hospitals.  A CMS is a centralized location where a user can login and manage, edit and publish content to a website, without the knowledge of website development or programing.</p>
                    <p>
                        The guide can be used as a step-by-step manual to learn the ins and outs of updating web content, or it can be used as a reference guide. Please use the navigation menu on the left to quickly jump to any section. If you run into an issue that you cannot solve with the contents of this guide, please contact a member of the communications team.
                    </p>




                </div>

                <!-- Getting Started
  ================================================== -->

                <div class="bs-docs-section">
                    <div class="page-header">
                        <h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
                    </div>

                    <h2 id="login">Logging In</h2>
                    <p>Before you can make any changes to the site, you need to log in. Click the “Staff Login” link in the header or footer of America’s Essential Hospitals’ homepage, or go directly to <a href="http://essentialhospitals.org/wp-admin" target="_blank">http://essentialhospitals.org/wp-admin</a>. Log in with the username and password that has been emailed to you. If you do not have an account, request one by emailing a member of the  communications team.</p>

                    <h2 id="dashboard">Dashboard</h2>

                    <p>Once you’ve logged in, the dashboard appears. This is your main administration homepage. At the very top of your dashboard (and across every page) you will see the admin toolbar. The toolbar is a way of easily accessing some of the most common CMS features. As long as you are logged in, the toolbar will be visible when you’re looking at the CMS and when you visit a page of the website itself in your browser. This bar only appears if you are currently logged into the CMS, which means that it won’t be visible to site visitors.</p>
                    <p>From the dashboard view, just below the toolbar, you will see two dropdowns: Screen Options and Help. The Screen Options dropdown allows you to control the amount of items you can see on a screen--this is a very useful feature that is consistent on every page in the CMS. Also on your dashboard you will see multiple dashboard panels. These panels give you a quick overview of the content on your site and provide quick access to specific areas of the CMS.</p>

                    <h2 id="menu-options">Dashboard Menu Items</h2>

                    <p>Down the left side of the dashboard on every page, you will see your main admin navigation menu. This is where you’ll find all the options to update and configure your site.</p>
                    <p>Hovering your cursor over each of the main menu options will display a ‘fly-out’ menu with various choices for that particular menu option. Once you click each of the main menu options, that particular menu will expand to show all the available options within that section. Based on your account access level, you may be limited to specific menu options.

                    <p>The main menu options and their usage are:</p></p>

                <!-- Creating and Editing Posts
  ================================================== -->

                <div class="bs-docs-section">
                    <div class="page-header">
                        <h1 id="posts">Creating and Editing Posts</h1>
                    </div>
                    <p>To create or edit an article, first click on the menu option of where the article will be published on the website (Blog, Action, Quality, etc.) After clicking on the menu option, you will be shown a list of posts already created in that specific section of the website. The information displayed includes the post Title, Author, Tags, Number of Comments, and either the Date Published, Date Scheduled, or the Date the post was Last Modified. The screen will look similar to the screen below.</p>
                   <img src="assets/img/dash-allposts.png">

                   <p> At the top of the page, you can view how many posts in total you have in your site, how many are Published, Scheduled, Sticky, Pending, in Draft or in the Trash.</p>

                   <p> When hovering your cursor over each row, a few links will appear beneath the post title:

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Edit</strong> – Allows you to edit your post. This is the same as clicking on the post title</li>
                        <li><strong>Quick Edit</strong> – Allows you to edit basic post information such as Title, Slug (shortened URL), and Date, plus a few other options</li>
                        <li><strong>Trash </strong>– Sends the post to the Trash. Once the trash is emptied, the page is deleted permanently</li>
                        <li><strong>View</strong> – Displays the post. If the post hasn’t been published yet, this will say Preview</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p> You can also filter the pages that are displayed using the dropdown lists and the Filter button.</p>

                    <h2 id="posts-add">Adding a New Post</h2>
                    <p>To add a new post, click the Add New link in the left navigation. You will be presented with a page similar to the image below.</p>

                    <img src="assets/img/dash-dashpost.png">

                    <p>The first thing you will want to do is give your post a title. Simply enter a title into the text field that reads “Enter title here.”.</p>

                    <p>Once you enter a title, a permalink will automatically be generated. A permalink is the actual permanent URL of the article when the post is published live. You can edit the permalink by clicking the “Edit” button to the right of the permalink..</p>

                    <h2 id="posts-format">Formatting Post Content</h2>
                    <p>The tool used to enter content into your post is very similar to a regular word processor, like MS Word, with toolbar buttons that allow you to format the text. At the top of the editor window, there are two tabs: “Visual” and “Text”. These switch the editor view between the Visual editor and the Text editor. The Text view will enable you to view the HTML code that makes up your content. For the more experienced users this can be helpful at times, but for those not familiar with HTML tags, it’s not recommended--stick to the Visual Editor.</p>

                    <p>At the top of the editor window where you type your content, there are numerous formatting buttons. Clicking the Show/Hide Kitchen Sink button <img src="assets/img/dash-kitchensink.png"> will show or hide a second line of formatting buttons that give you extra functionality. The editor buttons perform the following functions:.</p>

                    <center><img src="assets/img/dash-addlink.png"></center>
                    <p>To create a link in text, highlight the text you wish to link, and then click on the link icon in the editor. Once the link icon is selected, you will see a pop-up dialog. Simply insert the web address you want to link to in the URL field (make sure to include “http://”), add a title to give meaning to the link (it will show when someone hovers over the link), and choose whether or not to open the link in a new window/tab or stay in the current window/tab.</p>

                    <p>NOTE: The CMS makes it easy to create links internally within your website. Click on the “Link to existing content” text and use the search box to find a post or page. When you find the one you want, click on it. The text you highlighted in the editor will now link to that post or page. </p>

                    <p>NOTE: Anytime you are linking to an external website (anything not on essentialhospitals.org) you should check the “Open link in a new window/tab” checkbox to force the link to open in a new window and prevent users from leaving your website. Links to other pages within our website should open in the same window.</p>

                    <p>Once you’re done, click Add Link and the link has been created. Preview your content, then click your links to ensure they work properly. </p>


                    <h2 id="posts-img">Adding Images to posts</h2>
                    <p>To insert an image into your page/post, click the Add Media button (located above the text editor on the left side) and then simply drag your image(s) from wherever they are on your computer, into the browser window. Your file(s) will be automatically uploaded. Alternatively, click the Select Files button and then select the file(s) that you’d like to upload, using the dialog window that is displayed.</p>

                    <img src="assets/img/dash-mediamodal.png">

                    <p>Once your image is uploaded, your Media Library, which contains all your previously uploaded images, is displayed. The image(s) that you’ve just uploaded will be automatically selected for easy insertion into your post.</p>

                    <p>The properties of the currently highlighted image will be shown on the right-hand side of the Insert Media window. These properties include the filename, the date the file was uploaded, and the image size. Here you can also change the image Title, Caption, Alt Text and Description for each image, as well as the Alignment, Link, and the Size at which the image is inserted. See below for descriptions of each:</p>
					<ul>
                    	<li><strong>Title</strong> – is displayed as a tooltip when the mouse cursor hovers over the image in the browser. The title is important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and should always be considered.</li>
                    	<li><strong>Caption</strong> – is displayed underneath the image as a short description</li>
                    	<li><strong>Alt Text</strong> – is displayed when the browser can’t render the image. It’s also used by screen readers for visually impaired users, so it’s important to fill out this field with a description of the image. It also plays a part in your website SEO. Since search engines can’t ‘read’ images, they rely on the Alt Text. In addition, this field is a requirement for meeting federal 508 compliance.</li>
                    	<li><strong>Description</strong> – is usually displayed for internal purposes on the media library page, where all uploaded files reside,  and is not required. This will not show up anywhere on the live website.</li>
					</ul>

                    <p>For each image, you can select how you would like the image aligned, either left, center, or right, using the alignment dropdown list. It is recommend to always left align images.</p>

                    <p>You can also change what the inserted image(s) will link to if a user clicks on the image, using the Link To dropdown list. It is recommend to either link to a “Custom URL” or select “None.”</p>

                    <p>When your image(s) are uploaded, the CMS will also create several copies of your file at various sizes. You can choose which one you’d like to insert into the page using the size dropdown list. To insert the image at the exact size you uploaded, simply select Full Size. Next to each size listed in this dropdown will be the actual dimensions of the image, in pixels (e.g. 300 x 300). Image should be at least 600px wide in size</p>

                    <p>Once you’ve selected all your images, click the “insert into post” button to insert the selected image(s) into your post at the current cursor position</p>

                    <p>If you would like to further adjust an image that has been inserted into the editor, simply click or hover on the image and two icons will appear. Clicking the left icon <img src="assets/img/btn-edit.png"> allows you to edit the image properties, such as the size, alignment and title. Clicking the right icon <img src="assets/img/btn-imgedit.png"> will delete the image from your content. It will only remove the image from your page or post; it will not delete the image from your Media Library.</p>





                    <h2 id="posts-pdf">Adding PDF Files into a Post</h2>
                    <p>Uploading a PDF file to your site is very similar to uploading an image. Begin by clicking the ‘Add Media’ button. You will see the ‘Insert Media’ dialogue pop up. Simply upload the PDF file from your computer. Once it is uploaded, make sure to fill out the “attachment detail” in the right sidebar. For PDF files, it is only required to input a Title field. This is the text that will be linked to the PDF when the post is published. Also make sure the the ‘Link To:’ dropdown field is selected at ‘Media File’. Once completed, click “Insert into post” and you should see text link in your editor that links to the PDF file.</p>


                    <h2 id="posts-vid">Inserting Video, Audio, or Other File Type</h2>
                    <p>The procedure for inserting any other type of file into your post is exactly the same as inserting an Image. Simply click the Add Media button. Once the relevant popup window displays, perform the same steps to upload your file to your site and to insert it into your post.</p>

                    <p>When inserting video or audio files, you can select Embed Media Player from the Embed or Link dropdown list in the Insert Media pop-up window to use the new audio and video players that are now built into WordPress. Supported audio/video formats include M4a, MP4, OGG, WebM, FLV, WMV, MP3, WAV and WMA files.</p>

                    <p>Another way to add video or other content into your pages is through embedding media hosted on another website. A popular example of this is embedding a YouTube video into your page. In order to embed media, you must obtain the embed code from the website hosting the media. Most of the time, you can find this by clicking the “Embed” or “Share” button beside or under the video player. The embed code will look something like this: </p>

                     <pre><code class="html">&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/TZRtAY1n7BE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen> &lt;/iframe>  </code></pre>

                    <p>Simply copy this code, then paste it into the editor, using the “Text” view where you want the video to display. It is important that you are using the “Text” view when pasting the code in. If you are using the “Visual” editor, the video player will not be displayed.  When embedding the video, the width of the video should be no more than 580px wide.</p>

                    <h2 id="posts-other">Other Post Fields</h2>
                    <p>Once you have finished editing the content of your post, it is vital to input other information about your post that will determine how the post is displayed on the live site.</p>

                    <h3>Excerpts</h3>
                    <p>Enter a short introductory text about your post. This is the text that will be displayed on the homepage and landing pages underneath the title. </p>

                    <h3>External Links</h3>
                    <p>If you want to link to an external article or resource related to the post, enter the article title and URL here. You can add multiple links by clicking the + icon at the end of each row. These links will be displayed on the sidebar of the post page. </p>

                    <h3>Discussion</h3>
                    <p>If the “Allow Comments” box is checked, visitors will be allowed to add comments to the post. By Default, this is always checked.</p>

                    <h3>Author</h3>
                    <p>This allows you to change the author of the post to another user. Not all website administrators have this option; see a communications staff person if you need this option.</p>

                   <h3>Featured Image</h3>
                    <p>A Featured Image is the image that is representative for that post that will be displayed with the article title and excerpt when it is displayed on landing pages. Setting your featured image is very similar to adding an image into your post. After clicking the “set featured image” link, a pop-up window will display that looks similar to the one that displays when you add an image to your post. You can upload a new image to use as your Featured Image or you can simply choose from one of your previously uploaded images.</p>

                    <h3>Pin to Page</h3>
                    <p>If you want to pin, or force, the article to a specific landing page, choose the appropriate page where you want the post to be displayed. This is a request that a Super Admin will review before publishing.</p>

                    <h3>Topics, Tags and Series</h3>
                    <p>Each post must be categorized with certain taxonomy elements such as Topics, Tags, and Series. Depending on what section the post is published under, different rules apply on how to categorize content. Please refer to the <a href="#tax">Taxonomy section</a> for specific rules.</p>

                   <h3>Revisions</h3>
                    <p>You can revert to an old version of your post or page, and you can track the changes made to a post. This section will show you all previous revisions of the post and allow you to revert to an older version if necessary. This option will not normally be visible when you are creating a new post/page. </p>

                    <h3>Post Author Notes</h3>
                    <p>This box is used for internal purposes only so that the authors and reviewers can leave specific notes for each other within the post. This field is optional and will not be displayed on the live site. Think of this feature like “comments” in MS Word.</p>

                    <h3>Other Custom Fields</h3>
                    <p>You may see other custom input fields if you are editing a post or page that has specific content associated with it. These fields will be labeled with instructions that should help you input the correct content. Always check with a communications staff person before making changes to custom fields.</p>

                <!-- Saving and Publishing Posts
  ================================================== -->

                <div class="bs-docs-section">

                        <h1 id="saving">Saving and Publishing Posts</h1>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                    Once you’ve added all your content to your post you have the option of saving the post as a draft or publishing the page. Depending on your account access level, you may or may not to be allowed to publish the post live. If you do not have “Super Admin” access rights, please refer to the <a href="#publish">Staff Publishing Review Process Section</a> to learn more about the review processes.
                    </p>

                    <p>Clicking the Save Draft button will simply save your post. This is handy if you would like to come back at a later date to add more content or if you’re simply not ready to publish yet.  Clicking the Publish button will publish the post on the website.  Clicking the Preview button will show you a preview of the current post. Always preview your post before publishing it to check the formatting of the content and to ensure any links work properly.</p>

                    <p>There are also several options available when saving. By default the status is set to draft, but this can be changed by clicking the Edit link just to the right of Status within the Publish panel.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pending Review means the draft is waiting for review by an editor prior to publication.<li>
                        <li>Draft means the post has not been published and remains a draft for you.</li>
                    </ul>

<p>You can also change the visibility of the page by clicking the Edit link just to the right of Visibility within the Publish panel.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Public is the default and means the page is viewable to all. </li>
        <li>Password Protected allows you to assign a password to your page. Only people who have the password will be able to access the page.</li>
        <li>Private hides the content from the public completely. Normal users and visitors will not be aware of private content. Users will only see the private content when logged into the website with a member account.</li>
    </ul>



<p>By default, when you click the Publish button, your post is published immediately. To change this, click the Edit link just to the right of “Publish on:” within the Publish panel. You can then select the date and time that you’d like to schedule your post to “go live.” You must click the Publish button after you have set the date and time fields.</p>



                    <h2 id="removing">Removing a Post or Page</h2>

                    <p>When you remove a post or page, in the way this guide will show you, the page or post itself is not permanently deleted, but retained in “Trash” area. A page or post only becomes lost forever when you delete it from the “Trash” area. </p>

                    <p>There are two ways you can do this: The first way is, on a post listing page, place the mouse pointer over the page entry you want to remove (which will result in the options in the screenshot below being displayed), then click the “Trash” option. </p>
                    <p>
                    This method is fine for removing a single post or page at a time, but if you wanted to remove many posts or pages quickly, select the checkbox next to the post(s) or page(s) you want to remove, select the Move To Trash option in the Bulk Actions drop down at the top, then press the Apply button next to it.  </p>

                    <p>Once an item is moved to the “Trash” is can be restored. if you want to permanently delete the post or page, you must be sure to empty the “Trash” or click the “Permanently Delete” link for a single post.</p>

                    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
                        <h4>NOTE:</h4>
                        <p> Once a post has been published,  it can only be removed by a user with Super Admin privileges. </p>

                        <h1 id="tax">Taxonomy/Publishing Rules for Each Section</h1>
                    </div>

                    <h2 id="tax-overview">Overview of Taxonomy</h2>
                    <p>While editing posts, you will notice multiple input areas for different taxonomy elements, such as topics, tags, series, etc. These different categorizations are extremely important to each post in determining how content is organized on the website and where each post will be displayed. </p>


                    <h2 id="tax-manage">Managing Taxonomy</h2>
                    <p>Each taxonomy element will have a distinct set of input options. To manage a taxonomy set, click on the taxonomy link under one of the main menu items on the left navigation. For example, if you want to edit the Action Topics, click the “Action Topics” link under the Action dropdown.</p>
                    <p>When you click on the Action Topics menu option you’ll be shown the list of topics that have already been added along with some blank fields that allow you to add a new Topic.  To add a new topic, fill in the blank fields and then click the Add New Category button: Note: the following process is the same for editing any taxonomy set.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Name</strong> – The name is how it appears on your site</li>
                        <li><strong>Slug</strong> - The Slug is the URL-friendly version of the name. It is all lowercase and contains only letters, numbers, and hyphens.  If left blank, this is automatically generated.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parent</strong> - For this website, this should always be set to “None”.</li>
                        <li><strong>Description</strong> – This is a description of the current topic. This is only required for specific topics, such as the Institute centers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Edith</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Quick Edit</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>View</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>You can also edit current Topics by hovering over the topic list on the right.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Edit </strong>– Allows you to edit the Topic properties such as Name, Slug, Parent and Description</li>
                        <li><strong>Quick </strong> Edit – Allows you to quickly edit the Topic Name and Slug</li>
                        <li><strong>Delete</strong>  – Deletes the Topic permanently from the list of Topic. Deleting a Topic does not delete the posts in that Category </li>
                        <li><strong>View </strong>   – This will list all the posts that are currently using this Topic.</li>
                    </ul>

                    </div>

                    <h2 id="pages-overview">Overview</h2>
                     <p>Pages are very similar to posts;  pages differ in that they contain information that is by and large static. For example, “about” and “General information” pages and not dynamically fed into specific section of the website. Pages also are displayed differently than posts and can have specific templates. Anything that is in the “General” content stream will be managed under the “Pages” section.</p>


                    <h2 id="pages-new">Adding new Pages</h2>
                    <p>Create and editing pages is essentially the same process as creating a post, with a few different input fields. If you need help with the editor and advanced options, read the section <a href="#posts">Adding and Editing Content</a> for more information. The process to <a href="#saving">save and publish</a> pages is also the same for posts.</p>


                    <h2 id="pages-templates">Page Templates and Attributes</h2>
                    <p>An import thing to understand about pages is that they can have different page templates. The page template determines what content goes on a page and how the content is displayed on the live website.   Specific page templates are covered in detail in the next section.</p>

                    <p>To change the page template of the page that you are editing, edit the dropdown under the “Page Attributes” input section on the right sidebar. There are also other attributes that can be changed that are specific to pages.</p>

                    <p><strong>Page Parent</strong> - This allows you to set a parent page that introduces a hierarchy. This is helpful for page organization within the CMS, however it does not affect how the page menus are displayed on the  website. To edit the website menus and navigational structure, refer to the <a href="#menus">“Editing Menus”</a> section.</p>

                    <p><strong>Page Template</strong> - This is where you can change the template that the page uses. A list of page templates that can be used are listed below. </p>

                    <p><strong>Page Order</strong> - This should always be left at 0.</p>

                </div>

					</div>

                    <p>You will notice in the page editing view there are multiple input fields for specific sections. The main editor controls the content that is displayed in the first main column of the template. Below the main editor are more fields:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Second Column:</strong> Content in this field is displayed in the middle column of the template.</li>

                        <li><strong>Featured Image:</strong> The featured image that is associated with the default template will be displayed as the main banner image. This image should be 230px tall and at least 1200px wide.</li>
                        <li><strong>Banner Title:</strong> This is the title text that is overlayed on the banner image.</li>

                    <p>The homepage has a special page template that has a specific area that can be edited. The main areas of the homepage (the Face Images and article feeds) are dynamically generated by most recents posts or posts that are pinned to the homepage. The sections on the page that can be manually edited are:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Brand Text:</strong> Text that is displayed under the logo.</li>

                    <p>There are multiple landing page templates that are used throughout the site, such as Action, Quality, Education, Institute, Webinars and VirtualEd. The main content of these pages is dynamically generated by posts that are fed in, however, the banner image and banner title text can be changed. On these pages, the main editor should be blank and you can edit the Featured Image and Banner Title fields.</p>

                    <p>To create an announcement, click “Add New” under the Announcements menu item. There are three content fields that need to be completed for an announcement:</p>

                    <p>At the top of the Edit Menus page, a dropdown list displays at the top of the page that enables you to select the menu that you would like to edit. Simply select the menu you would like to edit from the Select a menu to edit dropdown list and then click the Select button. The menu items for your selected menu will then be displayed. </p>

                    <p>Your current list of menu items for the selected menu resides in the right hand column on the menu screen. The items in this right-hand column on the Menus page will match the menu items that appear on your website. To change the order of the menu items, simply click and drag an item to the desired location. Menu items can also have sub-items. To assign a menu item as a sub-item, simply drag the item below the parent item and move it to the right so that it is indented. Sections of the website, such as the Institute, that have tertiary menus will use menu sub-items to display the third-level menus. </p>

                    <p>Clicking on the down arrow next to each menu item name will show an options panel for that particular menu item. In this options panel, there are several items that can be updated/changed. You can show or hide extra fields such as Link Target, CSS Classes, or Description using the Screen Options tab at the very top-right of the screen.</p>

                    <h2 id="disc-overview">Overview</h2>
                    <p>All discussions, including public, hospital members only, and private discussions, on the website are listed under the “Discussions” menu item. Similar to a posts page, the discussion page lists all discussions. If the discussion listed has “- Pending” beside the title in the listing, then it is awaiting approval by a discussion moderator. All other discussions listed are open and active. </p>


                    <h2 id="disc-mod">Approving and Editing Discussions</h2>
                    <p>To view and edit a discussion, click on the title to edit. Discussions all contain a Title, Description, Tags, and Discussion Category.
                        <strong>Discussion Tags</strong> are created by the user that created the discussion and can be changed the same way post tags are changed.
                        <strongDiscussion Categories </strong>are listed below the tags and can be managed in the same way that post topics are. The Discussion Category determines where the discussion lives on the site. When a user creates a discussion, a category is automatically assigned to the discussion. The following categories are available:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Public: </strong>This means that the discussion is open to ANY user logged into the Member Network (not just members of the association, but members of the website).</li>
                        <li><strong>Private: </strong>Private discussions are hidden from the general public and only visible to hospital memeber users logged into the Member Network.</li>
                        <li><strong>Group: </strong>If a discussion is assigned to the group category, it means that is a discussion that lives within a Private Group/Program page. All discussions in the group category MUST have a sub category that determines the specific group that it is associated with (e.g. Fellows).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Once the discussion has been reviewed, you can approve it by simply changing the Publish status from “Pending” to “Published.” If you would not like to approve the post, simple click the “Move to Trash” link to discard the discussion.</p>
